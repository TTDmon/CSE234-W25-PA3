Based on the analysis of the DeepSeek-V3 model, we observe several distinct advantages of employing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures:

1. Parameter Efficiency

Despite the DeepSeek-V3 model having approximately 471.95 billion parameters, the MoE architecture ensures that at any given forward pass, only a small subset of these parameters are activated. This selective activation significantly reduces peak memory requirements, making it feasible to train massive models at manageable resource scales.

2. Reduced Computational Cost

The calculated peak memory usage of around 879 GB for such a large-scale model demonstrates MoE's practical computational benefits. By activating only a fraction of the experts during each inference, MoE models drastically reduce the memory and computational resources needed per forward pass compared to traditional dense architectures.

3. Cost-Effectiveness in Training

DeepSeek claims to have trained a highly performant MoE model with just around 5 million dollars. This affordability comes from the efficient allocation of computational resources enabled by MoE, thus allowing research and development teams to experiment and iterate more rapidly at lower costs.

4. Scalability

MoE architectures inherently support scaling to extremely large models by adding more experts rather than uniformly increasing layer sizes. This scalability can lead to improved performance in tasks like language modeling, enabling models to capture richer representations without proportional increases in computational overhead.
